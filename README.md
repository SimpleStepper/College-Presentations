## Pathways to a Grenner Future: CO₂ Emissions - [Project Link](https://github.com/SimpleStepper/College-Presentations/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/Final%20Presentation%20-%20DSCI%204700.pdf)
### Project Overview
This project examines global CO₂ emissions trends from **1960 to 2022** to identify key contributors, and propose data-driven solutions to support a **15% reduction** target **by 2030**. The analysis was conducted using **Excel**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI**, leveraging the Six Sigma **DMAIC methodology** to ensure a structured and effective approach.
### DMAIC Approach
1) Define: Identified key sources of fossil fuel-based CO₂ emissions (industries, transportation, food production).
2) Measure: Collected and cleaned data from OurWorldInData, ensuring accuracy in global emissions reporting.
3) Analyze: Discovered a **311% increase in CO₂ emissions** (1960-2022) and identified top contributors **(U.S., China, India, Russia**).
4) Improve: Developed interactive dashboards to visualize emissions trends and propose actionable insights.
5) Control: Recommended clean energy initiatives (electric vehicles, renewable energy adoption) to help governments and organizations track progress toward reduction goals.
### Key Findings
- CO₂ emissions have **increased by 311%** since 1960. Top 4 contributors (U.S., China, India, Russia) account for a significant share of global emissions.
- **High-income nations** are **plateauing**, while **upper-middle-income** nations’ emissions are **rising**
- Technology and policy measures impact emissions more than income levels alone
- Deficiencies in energy reporting affect accuracy—better tracking mechanisms needed
